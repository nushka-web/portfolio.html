<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Anushka Thomas — a passionate and driven web developer and data analyst with a strong interest in creating impactful and user-centered digital experiences. 
  I thrive on solving real-world problems through creativity, code, and collaboration. 
  With a foundation in  computer science and full-stack development, I enjoy turning ideas into functional, beautiful, and meaningful solutions.
  
  I’m always eager to learn, grow, and contribute to projects that make a difference.
   Whether I’m building a website, designing an interface, or participating in a hackathon, I bring energy, curiosity, and a commitment to excellence.
  
  Let’s build something amazing together.
</p>

<p>On the front end, I bring ideas to life through clean, user-friendly interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks. 
  On the back end, I connect the dots with databases, APIs, and logic that make apps work seamlessly. 
  But I don’t stop at “working” , I dive deeper, leveraging data to optimize performance, understand user behavior, and drive smarter decisions.

  With tools like Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau, I turn raw numbers into meaningful insights — whether it's identifying trends, automating workflows, or supporting business goals with data-driven thinking.</p>

<p>Let’s connect, collaborate, and create something remarkable.</p>
